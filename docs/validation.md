# Validation

Sophia's default validation path must not require native renderer libraries,
kernel devices, a display server, or network access. The default suite protects
the data model, protocol authorities, runtime reducers, renderer admission
records, and deterministic backend seams.

Run before committing ordinary changes:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --workspace --offline
```

The optional renderer-native features have extra local checks:

```sh
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe,egl-probe
```

The `gbm-probe` feature admits the safe `gbm` crate behind an optional feature.
It exercises fake and native GBM capability records while keeping the public
boundary reduced to capability health. This command must remain optional, and
the default workspace suite must continue to pass without native renderer
feature flags.

The `egl-probe` feature admits `khronos-egl` through the internal
`sophia-renderer-native-egl` adapter crate. That crate owns the unavoidable
unsafe dynamic EGL calls. Public renderer-live and backend-live tests assert
only reduced EGL startup and draw-smoke status.

The backend-live GBM feature suite includes an opt-in real-device smoke. Set
`SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_GBM_SMOKE=1` to let the test look for an openable
`/dev/dri/renderD*` node, route that backend-owned fd-like authority through the
GBM probe, and assert only reduced startup status. Without that environment
variable, the smoke returns early. This keeps CI deterministic and avoids
letting native driver crashes fail ordinary validation.

The combined `gbm-probe,egl-probe` backend suite uses the same environment gate
for the GBM-backed EGL path. When `SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_GBM_SMOKE=1` is set and an
openable render node exists, the test requires the private GBM/EGL draw smoke to
reach `ClearColorReady` and the offscreen presentation smoke to reach `Ready`.
It still exposes no render-node path, fd, GBM object, EGL object, pixel, driver
error, or KMS identity through Sophia's public reports. The real GBM/EGL smoke
runs the native path in a child test process so a driver crash reports as an
opt-in validation failure instead of terminating ordinary deterministic tests.

When touching renderer-native code, run both paths:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --offline
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe,egl-probe
```

Run the opt-in local hardware smoke only when you want real render-node
coverage:

```sh
SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_GBM_SMOKE=1 cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe,egl-probe
```
