# Research Log

This file records early decisions, assumptions, and open questions. Keep it
short and chronological.

## 2026-07-07: Project Name

The project is named **Sophia**.

Sophia means the XLibre-centered modern X11 architecture, not a Wayland
compositor with an X11 compatibility sidecar.

## 2026-07-07: Identity

Sophia is a research prototype for a modern X11 session:

- XLibre remains the client-facing X11 server.
- XLibre remains the Xnamespace authority.
- Sophia owns compositor-first input and rendering.
- Sophia uses an external WM policy process.
- Namespace crossings go through explicit portals.

## 2026-07-07: Language Direction

Use Rust for Sophia user-space components.

Use C for narrow XLibre patches and extensions.

Nim remains attractive for experimental external window managers because policy
processes are intentionally outside the compositor hot path.

## 2026-07-07: Architecture Distinction

Rejected framing:

```text
Wayland compositor with an XLibre bridge.
```

Accepted framing:

```text
XLibre-centered modern X11 session with an external display engine.
```

This distinction matters. In Sophia, XLibre is not a guest. It is the X11
authority. Sophia modernizes the input/rendering/policy structure around it.

## 2026-07-07: Current Local XLibre Facts

Local source tree: `/home/niltempus/src/xserver`.

Observed facts:

- Xnamespace exists and is enabled by the `namespace` build option.
- Selection names are rewritten per namespace.
- A draft/runtime `X-NAMESPACE` management protocol skeleton exists.
- XComposite and Damage exist as likely render handoff points.
- Input delivery still flows through legacy `XYToWindow`, sprite trace, grabs,
  focus, and DIX delivery.

Implication: rendering has a plausible existing seam. Compositor-routed input
needs explicit XLibre protocol/server work.

## Open Questions

- Should Sophia's compositor/display engine be a fully separate process or a new
  XLibre DDX backend during the first prototype?
- What is the smallest routed-input extension that preserves X11 grabs, focus,
  XI2, and Xnamespace checks?
- How much frame-perfect resize can be achieved with XComposite/Damage alone?
- Where should the X11 WM facade live: Sophia WM, Sophia X Bridge, or a separate
  helper?
- Which IPC format should Sophia use for its internal protocols?
